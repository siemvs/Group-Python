    "\n",
    "    This Python script generates a list of all prime numbers between 2 and 100 using for loops and conditional statements.\n",
    "    We excluded 1 since it is not a prime number. A prime number is defined as a a whole number greater than 1 that cannot\n",
    "    be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1.\n",
    "    This code checks each number in the specified range to determine if it is a prime number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "    The script uses one parameter which is range:\n",

    "    - Range: The range of numbers to be checked for prime numbers is from 2 to 100. The range does not include 1,\n",

    "   - A `for` loop checks divisibility of `num` by checking possible divisors from 2 up to the square root of `num`.\n",
    "    This is done to optimize the check by reducing unnecessary computations. Because if the square root of n has \n",
    "    a divisor greater than the square root of n, there must also be a corresponding divisor less than square root n.\n",
    "   - If `num` is found to be divisible by any divisor in this range, the Boolean variable `is_prime` is set to `False`, \n",
    "    indicating the number is not prime.\n",
